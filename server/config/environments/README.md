# Environments Directory

This directory contains environment-specific configuration files for the Rails application.

## Purpose

The environments directory contains configuration files for different environments:
- Development
- Test
- Production
- Staging (if applicable)

Each file configures Rails and its components for the specific needs of that environment.

## Common Files

- `development.rb` - Configuration for the development environment
- `test.rb` - Configuration for the test environment
- `production.rb` - Configuration for the production environment
- `staging.rb` - Configuration for the staging environment (if used)

## Environment-Specific Settings

### Development Environment

Development environment is optimized for developer productivity:
- Detailed error pages
- Code reloading
- Asset debugging
- Caching disabled by default

```ruby
# config/environments/development.rb
Rails.application.configure do
  # Settings for development environment
  
  # Enable/disable caching
  config.cache_classes = false
  
  # Do not eager load code on boot
  config.eager_load = false
  
  # Show full error reports
  config.consider_all_requests_local = true
  
  # Enable/disable caching
  config.action_controller.perform_caching = false
  
  # Print deprecation notices to the Rails logger
  config.active_support.deprecation = :log
  
  # Debug mode disables concatenation and preprocessing of assets
  config.assets.debug = true
end
```

### Test Environment

Test environment is optimized for speed and reliability of tests:
- No code reloading
- Caching enabled
- No asset compilation
- Error pages disabled

```ruby
# config/environments/test.rb
Rails.application.configure do
  # Settings for test environment
  
  # Do not eager load code on boot
  config.eager_load = false
  
  # Configure public file server for tests
  config.public_file_server.enabled = true
  
  # Show full error reports and disable caching
  config.consider_all_requests_local = true
  config.action_controller.perform_caching = false
  
  # Raise exceptions instead of rendering exception templates
  config.action_dispatch.show_exceptions = false
  
  # Disable request forgery protection
  config.action_controller.allow_forgery_protection = false
end
```

### Production Environment

Production environment is optimized for performance and security:
- Code is eager loaded
- Caching enabled
- Assets compiled and minified
- Detailed errors disabled
- Security features enabled

```ruby
# config/environments/production.rb
Rails.application.configure do
  # Settings for production environment
  
  # Eager load code on boot
  config.eager_load = true
  
  # Full error reports are disabled
  config.consider_all_requests_local = false
  
  # Enable caching
  config.action_controller.perform_caching = true
  
  # Use a different cache store in production
  config.cache_store = :mem_cache_store
  
  # Enable serving of static files
  config.public_file_server.enabled = ENV['RAILS_SERVE_STATIC_FILES'].present?
  
  # Compress CSS and JavaScript
  config.assets.js_compressor = :uglifier
  config.assets.css_compressor = :sass
  
  # Do not fallback to assets pipeline
  config.assets.compile = false
  
  # Force all access to the app over SSL
  config.force_ssl = true
  
  # Use the lowest log level to ensure availability of diagnostic information
  config.log_level = :info
end
```

## Best Practices

1. Keep environment-specific configuration in the appropriate files
2. Use environment variables for configuration that varies between deployments
3. Document non-standard configuration
4. Keep security-sensitive settings out of version control
5. Test configuration changes in a staging environment before deploying to production
6. Use consistent settings across similar environments (e.g., staging and production)
7. Regularly review and update environment configurations
